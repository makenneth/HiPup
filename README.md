# HiPup [Live Link](http://hipup.co)
HiPup is a full-stack web application inspired by MeetUp. It is a platform where pets can find groups by similar interests. If the owner can, why can't they?

HiPup utilizes two server, Ruby on Rails serves as the main API server, and NodeJS server serves to speed up the prerendering process.

## Technology Stack

## Implementation
### Multiple Sessions
```ruby
	def self.find_by_session_token(session_token)
		user = User.joins(:sessions).where("sessions.session_token = ?", session_token)
		user[0]
	end

	def destroy_session_token!(session_token)
		session = Session.find_by(user_id: self.id, session_token: session_token)
		session.destroy! if session
	end

	def log_in!(user)
    @current_user = user
    new_session = Session.create(user_id: @current_user.id, session_token: Session.generate_session_token)
  	session[:session_token] = new_session.session_token
  end

  def log_out!
  	current_user.destroy_session_token!(session[:session_token])
  	@current_user = nil
  	session[:session_token] = nil
  end
```
### Group
Upon user's visit HiPup, their locations are recorded by checking the approximate location from their IP address.

Users now have the options to filter groups by their location, by tag, and/or by a simple dynamic name search.

```javascript
    const libraries = this.state.groups.filter((group) => {
      return (
        group.title.toLowerCase().match(searchCriteria) &&
          group.tags.some(tag => this.state.selectedTags[tag.id])
      );
    });
```

## Future Directions for HiPup
- [ ] Direct Messaging / Friend requests
